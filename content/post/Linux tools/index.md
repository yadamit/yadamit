When you have seven courses in a semester, it gets a little hard to keep track of all assignment/project submission deadlines. Since I spend most of my time working on a linux terminal,  I felt it would be really helpful if I could check my deadlines with a simple command. So I wrote a command line tool in python which lists all upcoming deadlines, along with number of days left.
It might not be a very efficient tool but it gets the work done.

Feel free to check it out [here](https://github.com/yadamit/Deadlines).

I also wrote a To-Do tool which is a modified version of the Deadlines tool. 
Check it out [here](https://github.com/yadamit/TODO-tool).

Ping me if you have any suggestions or feedback.
