It was my last semester at IIT Kanpur when I decided to go for exchange semester program. I was nominated for Aalto University, Finland by Office of International Relations, IIT Kanpur. My exchange semester would start on Jan 1, 2020. It is the peak winter time in Finland where one might not get to see the sun at all for a couple of months. The daylight wouldn't last long and it would be dark before 4pm. But when I got there, I noticed something strange. It didn't snow at all this winter. According to locals, this was the warmest winter of their lifetime. The minimum tempeature I came accross was -8&deg;C while it usually goes around -30&deg;C. Locals blamed it on global warming.
